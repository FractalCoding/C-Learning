# C-Learning
**All C projects from my Intro to C class as well as my Computer Science 1 Class**

For those who stumbled across this repository, this repository contains all the projects and assignments I have done specifically for the classes I have taken in C. This repository is not intended to be compiled all at once, and instead each assignment should be regarded as a discrete project unless otherwise specified. So treat this not as one project, but as several projects lumped into one themed repository. This is not all my C projects I have ever done, and over time I will push all of those to GitHub as separate projects.

## **Intro to C Projects**

**For more information about the assignments for the *Intro to C* projects, contact Jerry Reed at Valencia College, the professor for my *Intro to C* class.**

## **Computer Science 1 Projects**

**For more information about the assignments for the *Computer Science 1* projects, contanct Tanvir Ahmed at the University of Central Florida, the professor for my *Computer Science 1* class.**

## THIS REPOSITORY IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF CLEANING UP FILES TO GET THEM READY FOR GITHUB.
