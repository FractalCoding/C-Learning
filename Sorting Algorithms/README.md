## **How To Compile This Code**

This file can be compiled as normal using any standard compiler. It is known to work when compiled with GCC.

## **Project Description**

Given a list of the number of pages in all the books in the school library, and a maximum limit of 
the number of pages you are willing to read, determine the maximum number of books you can 
fully read! 

**Note: This is the verbatim problem statement provided in the assignment.**

## **Input File Specifications**

Line 1 will contain a single integer, for number of test cases to process.

For each test case, there will be a line of two integers, the first being the number of books in the library, the second being the total number of pages you're willing to read.

The line after that will be a list of random unsorted integers the length of the number of books in the library.

## **Test Case Generator**

This file can be compiled normally. File generates randomly sized test cases, but if you would like to fix the number of test cases, the variables are labeled clearly enough for you to know which one to change to a fixed value, rather than a randomly generated one.
